The main code in a file named malloc.c.

Command to run the test with:
    make
    time ./a.out

The code works for the simple test given and a little test(that mallocs an array of 1000000 void pointers and then frees them(can be removed if needed to see break value with simple n stress test)) added by me and for 20 iterations of stress test (the value of number of blocks and max size being the same).

The values of stress test substituted:
checking = 1  
n_blocks = 100
max_sz =1000
n_iters(k)= 20

Sorry for delay in submission. Have a good day.
